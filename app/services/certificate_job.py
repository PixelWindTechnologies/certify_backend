"""
Scheduled job that auto-generates certificates for every enrollment that's
eligible and doesn't yet have a certificate. Wired up via APScheduler in
app/main.py, and can also be invoked manually / via a cron container for
a "serverless" deployment style.

An enrollment is eligible once Certificate Approval = Approved, and
either:
  - Status is explicitly Completed, or
  - Status isn't Dropped and the relieving date has already passed.

That second path exists because requiring every single enrollment to be
flipped to "Completed" by hand doesn't scale for bulk-imported students —
once their relieving date (set via Excel or the Enrollments page) is in
the past and nobody's marked them Dropped, the internship is over in
practice. When this path fires, the enrollment's status is also updated
to Completed so the Enrollments page reflects reality.

`render_certificate_for_enrollment` is shared with the certificate preview
endpoint so "preview" and "generate" always produce an identical document —
the only difference is whether a Certificate row gets persisted.
